Don't get your PRs kicked back; do your work up front.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Get All the Answers.</strong> Product and UX's job is to help you resolve all the edge cases. Make sure you understand:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>What to do if operations fail (bad user input, bad API response, bad login state, etc.)</li>\n<li>What device types you need to make this work on</li>\n<li>Confirm that any changed text, links, etc., is actually meant to change and not a typo</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Did someone else do it before?</strong> If your goal is not to create something totally new in the codebase, then it's possible that others have done something similar before. Even if you're doing something new, it may be that other people have had to deal with the same interfaces in completing their tickets. Searching completed tickets for some of the keywords in your ticket can often reveal past pull requests that can act as signposts on your path, or even give you some of the code you need. It's not cheating, it's understanding the codebase and applying past best practices.</li>\n<li><strong>Assess ways to do the ticket.</strong> Read the code and understand how things work in the module (if you're developing something from scratch, find similar things and understand how they work). If you want to discuss your approach with others, one option is to outline multiple options in ticket comments and direct the discussion there. It may also help to draw pictures at this stage.</li>\n<li><strong>Consult a Colleague.</strong> Ask someone what they think of your approaches. Senior and Principal Engineers are specifically paid to do these things, so don't be shy about asking them. If you're not co-located, tag them in the ticket comments (make sure to communicate out-of-band so they expect it). Agree on a preferred approach.</li>\n<li><strong>Go to a Domain Expert.</strong> If another team often works with this kind of code , then reach out to validate your approach.</li>\n<li><strong>Document the Chosen Approach.</strong> Describe the approach in the ticket comments. This comment doesn't need to be all-encompassing, but, if someone finds the ticket in 8 months and needs to do the same thing, they should be able to get a good start from your comment.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"faq\" tabindex=\"-1\">FAQ <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://wadearmstrong.com/things/How%20to%20Start%20a%20Ticket/\">#</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"do-i-need-to-do-this-every-time\" tabindex=\"-1\">Do I need to do this every time? <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://wadearmstrong.com/things/How%20to%20Start%20a%20Ticket/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>No, it's certainly too much effort for 1-day tickets, but the effort's worth it for anything you'll work on for longer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"seriously-this-seems-like-it-would-make-tickets-take-longer\" tabindex=\"-1\">Seriously, this seems like it would make tickets take longer <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://wadearmstrong.com/things/How%20to%20Start%20a%20Ticket/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>What really take a long time, both in terms of how much of a given sprint it takes up and, maybe more importantly, in terms of <em>how long it feels</em>, is when a ticket gets kicked back multiple times from code review.</p>\n<p>Think of this as a way to push all your mistakes to early in the process, when they can be redone cheaply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Changing your mind in a conversation is easier than changing code</li>\n<li>Drawing a new line or a new entity on a whiteboard is easier than changing code</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don't let yourself get bogged down, but, if you expect a ticket to take a few days, what's the downside of spending a couple hours up front?</p>\n<h3 id=\"shouldn-t-the-organization-trust-me-to-plan-my-story-on-my-own\" tabindex=\"-1\">Shouldn't the organization trust me to plan my story on my own? <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://wadearmstrong.com/things/How%20to%20Start%20a%20Ticket/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Sure, and they also trust you to execute the plan and write code. But most orgs also have code review, because we're all, together, smarter than any one of us, individually.

			"content_html": "<h1 id=\"commonjs-es-modules-and-why-to-test-natively-in-one-or-the-other\" tabindex=\"-1\">CommonJS, ES Modules, and Why to Test Natively in One or The Other <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://wadearmstrong.com/commonjs_esmodules_test-natively/\">#</a></h1>\n<p>In Javascript, there are two different ways that a given file can export functions, objects, values, and other components, for reuse in a second file or files — CommonJS ('CJS') and ES Modules ('ESM'). These two methods of export are actually surprisingly different, because they were designed for use in completely separate circumstances. Because they're so different, it's important to test them using a different toolchain.</p>\n<h2 id=\"where-you-ll-see-the-difference\" tabindex=\"-1\">Where You'll See The Difference <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://wadearmstrong.com/commonjs_esmodules_test-natively/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>If you've worked in Javascript for a while, you've probably become used to the <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v20.x/api/modules.html#requireid\"><code>require()</code></a> syntax for including the contents of other files, and the <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v20.x/api/modules.html#moduleexports\"><code>module.exports</code></a> syntax for exporting features from a file:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> importedModule <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">require</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'/path/to/module.js'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><br><br><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> value <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">importedModule</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>input<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br><br>module<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>exports <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br>\tvalue<br><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> </code></pre>\n<p>That's a tip-off that you're using CommonJS; ESM uses <a href=\"https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-imports\"><code>import</code></a> and <a href=\"https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-exports\"><code>export</code></a> for the same jobs:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> importedModule <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'/path/to/module.js'</span><br><br><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> value <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">importedModule</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>input<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br><br><span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">default</span> value<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre>\n<p>For most developers, this will be the only time they see a difference between the two approaches. Which syntax you use is probably going to be defined by the frameworks you're using:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Node natively supports CJS, but has supported ESM since v.12</li>\n<li>React supports both, but <a href=\"https://create-react-app.dev\">create-react-app</a> uses ESM (which one you choose will primarily be defined by your bundler)</li>\n<li>Angular supports both, but strongly prefers ESM</li>\n<li>Vue switched to ESM in v.13</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While technically you can mix CJS and ESM in a single project<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://wadearmstrong.com/commonjs_esmodules_test-natively/\" id=\"fnref1\">[1]</a></sup>, that's a good way to cause build chain problems. You can't practically mix the two syntaxes in a single file<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://wadearmstrong.com/commonjs_esmodules_test-natively/\" id=\"fnref2\">[2]</a></sup>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-the-difference-under-the-hood\" tabindex=\"-1\">What Is The Difference Under The Hood <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://wadearmstrong.com/commonjs_esmodules_test-natively/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>But it's not just build chains that have trouble with the two different export formats — there are actually significant technical differences in the way that ESM and CJS are implemented.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-commonjs-is-here\" tabindex=\"-1\">Why CommonJS is Here <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://wadearmstrong.com/commonjs_esmodules_test-natively/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>First, a little history. When Node first came around, there was no standardized way to include components from different javascript files. They chose CommonJS, one of the major proposals for module exporting and loading at the time, not least because it was straightforward to use on servers<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://wadearmstrong.com/commonjs_esmodules_test-natively/\" id=\"fnref3\">[3]</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>One thing that made it so straightforward on servers was that it loads all included modules <em>synchronously</em> — that is, it kind of assumes that the file containing the modules will just 'be there' when it hits the <code>require()</code> line in the code. This is true on servers, so that's a great choice for Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-es-modules-are-here\" tabindex=\"-1\">Why ES Modules are Here <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://wadearmstrong.com/commonjs_esmodules_test-natively/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Of course, on the Web, files are not at all 'just there' — they take a while to load from wherever in the world they are hosted. CJS's synchronous approach to loading would result in the browser appearing to stall as each dependency was loaded, in order; an asynchronous approach, matching the way assets like CSS and images are loaded in the browser, was clearly required.</p>\n<p>That's where ES Modules come in. They implement something called 'top level await', which is basically just a way of saying &quot;You know how <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await\"><code>await</code></a> works? Every ES Module is by default wrapped in that.&quot;</p>\n<h3 id=\"but-it-s-not-just-synchronous-vs-asynchronous\" tabindex=\"-1\">But it's Not Just Synchronous vs. Asynchronous <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://wadearmstrong.com/commonjs_esmodules_test-natively/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Understanding synchronous vs. asynchronous is a good first step, but the real difference under the hood — and the reason why you want to test natively in whatever exports approach your build chain uses — comes down to the consequences of being synchronous or asynchronous.</p>\n<p>Imagine your Javascript interpreter parsing a single file. It hits a line like:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> foo <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">47</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre>\n<p>The interpreter can then:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Allocate memory for the value of <code>foo</code> to inhabit</li>\n<li>Populate that memory with <code>47</code></li>\n<li>Move on and be done with it</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Nice and simple, right? But what if the value <code>47</code> isn't there yet?</p>\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> foo <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">await</span> <span class=\"token function\">fetchFortySeven</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre>\n<p>If you've used <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise\"><code>Promises</code></a> before, you'll know that the interpreter works more like:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Allocate memory for the value of <code>foo</code> to inhabit</li>\n<li>Populate that memory with a Promise</li>\n<li>Move on to the next thing</li>\n<li>Check periodically in the Event Loop for the Promise to be fulfilled</li>\n<li>...</li>\n<li>...</li>\n<li>Now finally populate the memory with <code>47</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This pretty much describes the under-the-hood difference between CJS and ESM.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CJS immediately and synchronously processes all exports and sets their value in memory at that time</li>\n<li>ESM asynchronously processes all exports and sets their value in memory when all required processes (loading, calculating, etc.) have been completed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a consequence of this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CJS exports <em>can never</em> be recalculated during a given execution; they are what they are at the initial export time. So, if you have a module that exports a default; waits for a Promise to resolve; then exports the new value, the CJS import will only ever get the default value<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://wadearmstrong.com/commonjs_esmodules_test-natively/\" id=\"fnref4\">[4]</a></sup>.</li>\n<li>ESM exports <em>can</em> be recalculated during a given execution. In the previous example, the exported value would change during the execution, and you would be able to access the new value.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"an-esm-testing-toolchain\" tabindex=\"-1\">An ESM Testing Toolchain <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://wadearmstrong.com/commonjs_esmodules_test-natively/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Obviously this means that you need to be careful in testing — you want to write tests that check the <em>actual</em> value the code will produce in production, and it's a problem if the tests assume the value will never change and it does (or vice versa). So stick to a testing toolchain that natively uses whatever module format your build chain exports.</p>\n<p>Facebook's excellent Jest testing framework <a href=\"https://jestjs.io/docs/ecmascript-modules\">does not yet support ES Modules well</a>, so, while it's a great choice for CJS build chains, you should avoid it for ESM.</p>\n<p>For ES Modules, I like the Mocha framework, which has <a href=\"https://mochajs.org/#nodejs-native-esm-support\">supported ESM since mid-2020</a>. It doesn't offer all of the great React-specific features you get for free in Jest, but it's a solid, flexible, and fast framework.</p>\n<p>Now you know the difference between ES Modules and CommonJS. Go out, and reuse your code!</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>And you may have, depending on the npm modules you use. <a href=\"https://wadearmstrong.com/commonjs_esmodules_test-natively/\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>You're basically using CJS and <code>require</code>ing external files to give you the ESM interfaces, and your build chain will need to reflect that you're using both, so you'd really better be determined to mix it up! <a href=\"https://wadearmstrong.com/commonjs_esmodules_test-natively/\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn3\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>The syntax for CJS is also, to my eyes at least, <a href=\"https://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html#amd\">cleaner than that of an early competitor, AMD</a> <a href=\"https://wadearmstrong.com/commonjs_esmodules_test-natively/\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn4\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>In practice, this is easy to get around: just export a Promise <a href=\"https://wadearmstrong.com/commonjs_esmodules_test-natively/\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n",

			"content_html": "<h1 id=\"console-log-vs-breakpoint\" tabindex=\"-1\">Console Log vs. Breakpoint <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://wadearmstrong.com/things/console-log_vs_breakpoint/\">#</a></h1>\n<p>I <code>console.log</code> a lot. And I know that’s not always classy. Folks look at me crosswise because I don’t open up a debugger — and all Web browsers have quite good debuggers these days<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://wadearmstrong.com/things/console-log_vs_breakpoint/\" id=\"fnref1\">[1]</a></sup> — but here’s the thing: it’s not just that I’m old-fashioned (although I am, and I certainly started developing well before decent in-browser debuggers), there’s acutally something about <code>console.log</code>ging (or fmt.printlning or echoing) that’s different than using a debugger. Logging out your code’s state is debugging from a specific perspective; using your browser debugger actually moves you to a different perspective.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-perspectives-work\" tabindex=\"-1\">How Perspectives Work <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://wadearmstrong.com/things/console-log_vs_breakpoint/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>In the social sciences<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://wadearmstrong.com/things/console-log_vs_breakpoint/\" id=\"fnref2\">[2]</a></sup>, there’s this concept of &quot;framing.&quot; A &quot;frame&quot; is a filter, more or less, through which we all take in and analyze information. Some filters are basic and come from our experiences in nature — &quot;Mom is good, this smells like Mom, it must be good&quot; — but most are socially-constructed — &quot;Eating fat makes me fat, so I’ll choose the 90% lean ground beef over the 10% fat ground beef.&quot;<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://wadearmstrong.com/things/console-log_vs_breakpoint/\" id=\"fnref3\">[3]</a></sup></p>\n<p>While the filter itself is an abstract entity, neuropsychologists have considerable evidence that something much like frames actually exists in your brain. The Spreading Activation Theory holds that the likelihood an individual retrieves a memory is directly proportional to the strength of the connections to that memory. Think of memory like a graph, with nodes connected in the center as a crazy-quilt, but out at the edges as trees, with memory retrieval starting at the center. Each node on the graph is connected more strongly or more weakly to its neighbors; heck, think of components of memory as having PageRank. To get to a node on the edge, you need the path from the center to that edge to have sufficient strength throughout to get you there; but, once far enough down a path, the connections from a given node in that path to a node in a completely different path are much weaker than the within-path connections.</p>\n<p>A graph, showing a few childhood memories networked together, with GI Joe's Lt. Falcon way out on his own connected only to GI Joe, while other nodes are linked to each other</p>\n<p>Here’s a trivial example: my childhood memories. Look how many paths there are to get from my happy memories of playing to my traumatic memory of crashing my bike. But you have to activate a specific path to get to my memories of my GI Joe Lt. Falcon action figure.</p>\n<p>What that means for all of us is that, when we get far enough down our semantic network, only one frame is available to us; others are just too weakly-connected to flip over to, at least not without significant mental effort. This happened to me in a job interview once — I was working on GDPR compliance at my old job, so was thinking about privacy of PII. My interviewer asked me how to keep a variable’s value private in Javascript in the browser. The correct answer was &quot;using a closure,&quot; but, focused on the GDPR frame, I said something like &quot;once you send it to the browser, man, everyone can see it! It’s the wild west out there! There’s no privacy.&quot;<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://wadearmstrong.com/things/console-log_vs_breakpoint/\" id=\"fnref4\">[4]</a></sup> The concept of &quot;private&quot; was framed in my mind as &quot;information,&quot; not &quot;variable private to a given function or method,&quot; so I missed it.</p>\n<p>This is all a long way of saying that the frame you use to filter information from the world around you absolutely neurologically limits your ability to think about that information in a different way. But, when we’re stuck on a programming (or, really, any life) challenge, thinking about the problem in a different way is essential to moving forward.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-debugger-perspective\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Debugger Perspective <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://wadearmstrong.com/things/console-log_vs_breakpoint/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>It’s kind of obvious where I’m going here: using a debugger gives you a specific frame through which you look at the world. To be more exact, it gives you the frame of looking at the code from the outside.</p>\n<p>Which is great! This allows us all to use debuggers to understand code we have no business understanding. Third-party library? No problem! Spooky behavior potentially caused by the platform not adhering to the spec? I can figure that out!</p>\n<p>But it is that divorced-from-the-source-code frame, and it’s hard to get back into the code directly from the debugger. Not physically, since usually there’s a line number or even a link to the line in your IDE; but in your mental model. You need to store lots of state in your head: information of where you’re looking in your code; what drives the execution of that code; which inputs you care about; and more.</p>\n<p>Debugging is thus great if you have something behaving wrong and you don’t know why. You can use its frame to evacuate presuppositions from your head and look fresh from the outside.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-logging-perspective\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Logging Perspective <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://wadearmstrong.com/things/console-log_vs_breakpoint/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>But, look, sometimes everything is going great. You’re writing code, you’re on a roll, but you need to know: what is the shape of this data here? Do these two lines really execute out-of-order? We fall into that branch, right?</p>\n<p>Then your perspective is inside the code. And what works well in that frame? Well, logging out the data that you need. Yeah, in a lot of cases you can set a breakpoint and watch what’s going on around that, but the point is that you don’t need a generic act that might give you all different kinds of information: you need to specifically get the piece of data you want.</p>\n<p>Logging gives you complete control of that. It defines the frame as &quot;I’m here, what’s the situation with ?&quot;</p>\n<p>Logging is also great when you’re refactoring. Want to make sure you’re still executing a step in some complex branching process that all flows back together in the end? Well, step through dozens of operations… or just put one <code>console.log('in interestingFunction()')</code> in the right place. Doesn’t matter how you change your branching structure, you don’t have to keep track of where you want to set the breakpoint, you just get the informtion you need, when it’s available.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-t-we-all-just-get-along\" tabindex=\"-1\">Can’t We All Just Get Along? <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://wadearmstrong.com/things/console-log_vs_breakpoint/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I may be a bad developer, but it’s not because I <code>console.log()</code> things a lot.
